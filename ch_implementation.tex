\chapter{Implementation}

We implemeted our solution to the exploration task in the ROS framework.

\section{Architecture}
\label{sec:impl_arch}

The architecture of the system is designed to fit into the modular ROS framework. Each functional part is implemented as a standalone ROS node, which can be used independently on the rest of them.

A node runs the optoforce driver and publishes the force readings to a common topic. If any other component wishes to use them, they are available system-wide.

The exploration algorithm runs in a node of its own. Exploration of the environment can be triggered by \REV{calling an action the exploration node implements}. The node depends on the move\_group node running with all its configuration loaded.


\section{Optoforce driver}
\label{sec:opto_driver}

The Optoforce driver is implemented in Python.
